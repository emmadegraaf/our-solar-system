<h2>Characteristics of the planets</h2>
<h2>Mercury</h2>>
<h3>Mercury is the nearest planet to the sun, and is only slightly larger than our earth's moon(2439.7kilometers in radius). even though mercury is closer to the sun than any other planet, it is not the hottest one, that's venus. This is because the planet has a thin exmosphere that cannot keep the warmth of the sun inside of it. mercury was formed 4.5 billion years ago. 
    It is a terrestrial planet; it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. The surface of this planet is similar to the one on our moon, a solid cratered surface. one “day” on mercury would take 59 “earth days” this is as mercury spins quite slowly compared to earth. because mercury is the closest planet to the sun it has the shortest year of all planets, 88 days. </h3>
