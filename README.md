introduction

background information

characteristics(of planets)
	what/when is something in space a planet?
	planets in our solar system(and how to recocnise them)
	mercury:
Mercury is the nearest planet to the sun, and is only slightly larger than our earth's moon(2439.7kilometers in radius). even though mercury is closer to the sun than any other planet, it is not the hottest one, that's venus. This is because the planet has a thin exmosphere that cannot keep the warmth of the sun inside of it. mercury was formed 4.5 billion years ago. 
It is a terrestrial planet; it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. The surface of this planet is similar to the one on our moon, a solid cratered surface. one “day” on mercury would take 59 “earth days” this is as mercury spins quite slowly compared to earth. because mercury is the closest planet to the sun it has the shortest year of all planets, 88 days. 
	venus:
Venus is one of the innermost terrestrial planets in the solar system. It is similar to earth, and is regularly called the earth's twin because of the similarities in size and density. Venus however has a thick and toxic atmosphere, it's wrapped in sulfuric acid, a corrosive substance that is destructive to skin, eyes, teeth, and lungs. Because of this atmosphere, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, the surface temperature is 475 degrees celsius, hot enough to melt lead. 
Venus was the first planet to be explored with a spacecraft, NASA’s mariner 2 spotted the planet on 12th of december 1972. Since then a number of spacecraft have explored Venus, but did not survive long due the heat and pressure of the planet. This planet rotates very slowly, one day on Venus lasts about 243 earth days. However, the planet orbits the sun faster than the earth. One year on Venus takes 225 earth days, so one venus day lasts longer than one venus year!
