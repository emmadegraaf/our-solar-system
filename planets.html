      <h1>Mercury</h1>
      <p class="planet-description">
        Mercury, it is the closest planet to the sun. 
        It's slightly larger than the Earth's moon with a radius of approximately 2439.7 kilometers. 
        Even though it is the planet closest to the sun it's not the hottest one, that Venus. 
        This is because Mercury has a thin exosphere that cannot hold the sun’s warmth. 
        The planet formed about 4.5 billion years ago and is a terrestrial planet. 
        Its surface is similar to the one our moon has. 
        A day on Mercury, one complete rotation on its axis, 
        takes about 59 Earth days due to its slow spin compared to Earth. 
        Being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury has the shortest year among all planets, 
        completing an orbit in just 88 Earth days. 
        Mercury has a diameter of nearly 5000 km and is only 58 million kilometers from the Sun. 
        The planet does not have any moons and experiences surface temperatures ranging from +430°C to -170°C, 
        with an average temperature of 180°C. 
        Mercury has been known since ancient times, 
        although its close position to the Sun makes it hard to observe and study in detail.

      <h1>Venus</h1>
      <p class="planet-description">
        Venus, it is one of the inner terrestrial planets, 
        and often referred to as earth's twin due to the similarities in size and density. 
        There are however significant differences. Venus has a thick and toxic atmosphere, 
        with clouds of sulfuric acid, which makes it the hottest planet in our solar system. 
        The surface temperature on the planet reaches 475 degrees celsius, which is hot enough to melt lead.
        NASA's Mariner 2 was the first spacecraft to spot Venus on December 12, 1972. 
        Explorations have been challenging due to the planet's extreme heat and pressure, 
        resulting in short missions. 
        Venus has an exceptionally slow rotation, with one day lasting about 243 Earth days. 
        Surprisingly, Venus completes its orbit around the Sun faster than Earth, making its year last approximately 225 Earth days. 
        This results in that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.
        The planet has a diameter of about 12,000km and rests around 110 million kilometers away from the Sun. 
        The outer cloud layer of Venus holds a temperature of around 482 degrees celsius. 
        Venus does not have a moon and has been observed and seen since long in history, 
        and is visible to the naked eye like the evening and morning stars.

      <h1>Earth</h1>
      <p class="planet-description">
        Earth, our planet, it is the only place that we know of (so far) that is inhabited by living organisms. 
        It has a radius of 6371 kilometres, making it the biggest of the four terrestrial planets closest to the sun. 
        It is however only the fifth largest planet overall in the solar system. 
        It's slightly bigger than venus and the only planet here that has liquid water on the surface. 
        The earth has a diameter of almost 13000 km and is about 150 million kilometres away from the sun. 
        It takes 1 year to complete one orbit around the sun and rotates once every 24 hours (1 day) on its own axis. 
        The average surface temperature is 15° Celsius. 
        The earth's axis is at an angle of 23.45 degrees, this causes the seasons that we have. 
        Earth is the only planet that has only one moon, which is the most recognizable thing in the night sky. 
        But more about moons later.

      <h1>Mars</h1>
      <p class="planet-description">
        Mars is the fourth planet on the list, it’s a cold desert planet and has a very thin atmosphere. 
        The atmosphere is mostly made up from mostly carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen, and a little bit of oxygen and water vapour. 
        It is half the size of earth, so its diameter is around 6800 kilometres long. 
        The surface of mars is rocky, the solid surface characterised by its volcanoes, 
        impacts winds, crustal movements, and chemical reactions. 
        The redness of Mars’ surface comes from iron minerals that oxidise /rust which makes the surface look red.
        A Lot of missions have been successful on this planet. 
        In 2021 there have been sent three spacecrafts sent to the planet, Perseverance, The Hope, and Tianwen-1. 
        Mars is the most explored body in our solar system.

        Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, 
        it's one of the four other gas giants. 
        They do not have a solid surface to land on, there have been however nine spacecrafts that have visited jupiter. 
        It was first discovered in 1610 by galileo galilei. 
        Just like all the other gas giants jupiter has a moons and rings, 
        more than 75 moons and four rings have been discovered to this day. 
        Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system and has a diameter of 143,000 kilometres. 
        It takes the planet 12 years to orbit the sun, it is about 780 million kilometres away from the sun. 
        This planet has been known for a very long time and can be seen in the sky without any equipment(at specific times/places).</p>

      <p class="planet-description">
        Saturn is the second gas giant and the second largest planet. 
        One of the most noticeable things of this planet are its rings, 
        Saturn has seven rings with several gaps in between them. 
        The rings are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rocks and other stuff like dust. 
        It's a big planet and has a diameter of about 120,000 kilometres. 
        It's about 1.4 billion kilometres from the sun, which results in it taking 29 years to orbit the sun. 
        Besides its rings, Saturn also has a lot of moons, 146 to this day. 
        While Saturn itself is not possible for life to live on because of its gas ‘surface’, 
        some of its moons do have conditions that might support life.</p>

        It has a diameter of more than 50000 km and is about 2.9 billion km from the Sun. 
        Uranus takes 84 years to orbit the sun. An Uranus day lasts just under 16 hours. 
        The temperature of the outer cloud layer is -193° Celsius, which is lower than that of Neptune. 
        27 moons of Neptune are known. 
        Uranus was discovered by Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel in 1781. 
        The pale green-blue colour is the main characteristic of the planet. 
        It also has a system of rings.
