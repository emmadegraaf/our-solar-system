      <h2>About the Solar System</h2>
      <!-- Content goes here -->
      <p>The solar system is a vast and fascinating place, consisting of the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies. It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. The Sun, located at the center, provides heat, light, and energy to the solar system. The planets orbit around the Sun in elliptical paths, with each planet having its unique characteristics and features.</p>

      <!-- Content goes here -->
      <p>Our solar system consists of eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet has its distinct size, composition, atmosphere, and moons. For example, Earth is the only planet known to support life, while Jupiter is the largest planet with a massive storm called the Great Red Spot. Explore each planet's fascinating details, such as their surface conditions, geological features, and potential for exploration and habitation.</p>

      <h2>Sun</h2>
      <!-- Content goes here -->
      <p>The Sun is a massive, glowing ball of gas that accounts for 99.8% of the total mass in the solar system. It provides light, heat, and energy through a process called nuclear fusion. The Sun is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium and has several layers, including the core, radiative zone, and convective zone. Learn more about the Sun's role in the solar system, its solar flares and prominences, and the importance of solar energy for life on Earth.      </p>

      <h2>Other Celestial Bodies</h2>
      <!-- Content goes here -->
      <p>In addition to planets, the solar system contains various celestial bodies. This section can cover notable objects such as dwarf planets (e.g., Pluto and Eris), asteroids (rocky objects orbiting the Sun), comets (icy bodies that develop tails as they approach the Sun), and the Kuiper Belt (a region beyond Neptune containing icy objects). Explore the characteristics, origins, and significance of these celestial bodies in the solar system.</p>
